This is not production ready, only proof of concept. After working with this for awhile, I'd recommend using Openresty for custom nginx. 

# Nginx http module with Go

This repository is made for playing [VS Code Remote development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) and nginx custom module. I encourage you to download [VS Code Insider](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) and try this remote development feature. It's really cool üòé

## Prerequisite
1. Install docker 

## Get started
1. Start VS Code and setup for remote development
2. Pressing `‚áß‚åòB` or running Run Build Task
3. Let's hacking üêë
